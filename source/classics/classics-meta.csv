Hart and is the oldest digital library. This dataset is a collection of the top 1000 most popular books on Project Gutenberg, as determined by downloads. Each book has information about its authorship, publication date, congressional classication, and a few other fields. It also has some simple, computed statistics based on common metrics such as sentiment analysis, Flesch Kincaid Reading level, and average sentence length.
